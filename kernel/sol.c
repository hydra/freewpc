/**
 * \file
 * \brief Handles updating the solenoids.
 * The state of the solenoids is maintained in memory; the
 * actual I/O is written at IRQ time to refresh the hardware.
 *
 * Each solenoid set (of 8) is serviced during each successive 1ms.
 * Real-time update cycles through 4 sets of outputs, so
 * the effective service time per solenoid is once every 4ms.
 * (For some machines there are more than 4 sets to be serviced;
 * in that case it is necessary to service more than 1 set sometimes.)
 *
 * Each solenoid a timer that allows it to remain active for up to 255
 * iterations, or a total duration of 1.02s.  If a coil needs to
 * energize longer than that, it is up to the task level to
 * continue to kick it.  Each also has an 8-stage duty cycle,
 * allowing anywhere from full power to 1/8th power (one pulse
 * per 33ms).
 *
 * The algorithm has been designed to minimize hardware damage due
 * to software failures.  A random write to any of the solenoid timers
 * would cause that solenoid to turn on, but at most for 1.02s, since
 * the timer countdown automatically restores it to zero.
