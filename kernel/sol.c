/**
 * \file
 * \brief Handles updating the solenoids.
 *
 * The state of the solenoids is maintained in memory; the
 * actual I/O is written at IRQ time to refresh the hardware, every 4ms.
 *
 * There are two different mechanisms here, one for solenoids and one for
 * flashers.  For the flashers, there is duplicate inline code for each
 * flasher that controls it.  This allows multiple flashers to run in
 * parallel.  For the solenoids (the first 16 on WPC), there is a single
 * update function, with the solenoid number as a parameter, so only one
 * of these can run at a time.
 *
 * A request specifies both a time (in 4ms increments) and a duty cycle
 * (as low as 1/8, up to full 100% on).  The timer allows a maximum
 * duration of about 1 second.  The default time and duty cycle for the
 * shared solenoid driver comes from a table that is built from the
 * parameters in the [drives] section of the machine description.
 *
 * When using the shared driver, if a request is made while the driver
 * is already pulsing another solenoid, that request can be queued up
 * so the caller does not have to wait for it.
 *
 * If more customized control is needed, a device driver should be
 * employed instead and these APIs should be skipped altogether.
