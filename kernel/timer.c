 * \brief Timer APIs
 *
 * Timers are special cases of tasks; they just all run the same
 * function, counting down the time, then exiting.  Actually, there
 * are a few different predefined timer functions, which offer
 * slightly different behavior.
 *
 * The timer APIs are very similar to the task APIs, just with the
 * addition of a timeout value in most places.
