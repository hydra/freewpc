/**
 * \file
 * \brief Lamp effect management
 *
 * A leff, or lamp effect, is a temporary override of the lamp matrix
 * bits for a "light show".  At present, the leff module operates
 * independently, but identically to the display effect module.
 * See deff.c for details.
 *
 * Multiple lamp effects are allowed to run concurrently.
 * (TODO : as long as they do not use the same lamps!.)   There are
 * really two different kinds of lamp effects: temporary "light shows" and
 * long-running effects.  Light shows can be skipped if possible,
 * but other effects indicate critical information to the player;
 * e.g. ballsaver is active, jets at max, etc.  The latter usually
 * do not overlap.  The strategy should be to treat these separately.
 * Temporary light shows act more like display effects and can only
 * be one at a time.  Other lamp effects "share" one of the leff
 * matrices, and can run concurrently.
