/**
 * \file
 * \brief Idle processing
 *
 * This module runs at idle time -- when there are no tasks that need
 * to be scheduled.  It is the third tier of priorities, behind
 * interrupt-level and task-level.  The task scheduler will not call
 * these functions more frequently than once per 16ms though.
 *
 * Functions that need to run as often as possible should register for
 * the 'idle' event.  Most functions can get by running less often, though:
 * those should register one of the time-based idle events.  For example,
 * 'idle_every_100ms' would only run once every 100ms.
 *
 * Time-based idle functions are not guaranteed to run as soon as the
 * time has elapsed, if there are lots of tasks still runnable.  So you
 * cannot use idle to do any realtime processing.  However, this module
 * does track when it is falling behind, and will try to compensate.
 * For example, if the 100ms handlers don't get invoked until after 110ms,
 * next time it will run after only 90ms more has elapsed.  In the long run,
 * it will always average out to 100ms.
 *
 * Time events are implemented for 100ms, 1 second, and 10 seconds.
 * Any other intervals need to be implemented by hooking one of these
 * and counting the time units yourself.
