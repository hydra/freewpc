/**
 * \file
 * \brief Debug output driver
 *
 * This module writes out debug messages (calls to dbprintf).
 * By default, these are sent to the parallel port, which works
 * in all versions of pinmame.
 *
 * If the Linux 'wpcdebug' program is running, messages are sent
 * to it instead, over the WPC debug port.
 *
 * On real hardware, there is no mechanism at present to see these
 * messages at all.
