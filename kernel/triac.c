/**
 * \file
 * \brief Manage the triacs.
 *
 * This controls the general illumination strings and some additional I/O.
 *
 * Theory of operation:
 *
 * The CPU generates an IRQ once every 960 microseconds.
 *
 * The GI is driven off 6.3VAC at a frequency of 60 Hz (US).
 * This means that 60 times a second, the sinusoidal AC voltage goes
 * through a complete cycle.  AC will cross zero twice during each cycle.
 * In between each of the zero points is a peak (one negative,
 * one positive per cycle).
 *
 * The AC module (ac.c) monitors the zerocross and tracks how
 * long it has been since the last crossing.
 *
 * The state of each triac is maintained by a latch (LS374) on the
 * power driver board.  When '1', the triac is enabled and allows
 * current to flow until the next zerocrossing point.  During this
 * time, the state of the latch is irrelevant; the triac is kept on.
 * When set to '0', the triac will be turned off at the next
 * zerocross point, if it isn't already off.  Note that the time that
 * a triac can be turned on varies, but the time it is turned off
 * is fixed.
 *
 * GI lamps can either be undimmed or dimmed.  In undimmed mode,
 * we just turn on/off the latched value and leave it there.
 * 'On' strings are permanently receiving power and thus run at
 * full intensity.  At the end of each half-cycle, the latch still
 * has a '1' for that string, and so the triac stays on.
 *
 * In dimmed mode, the latch is enabled and then
 * immediately disabled, at a particular point in the AC phase.
 * The triac is enabled from the point of the first write to the
 * next zerocross point.  The closer the writes are to the next
 * zerocrossing, the dimmer the lamps will be.  Maintaining the
 * lamps at this intensity requires rewriting the latch continuously
 * at the exact point in the AC cycle.
