/**
 * \file
 * \brief The main game state machine logic.
 *
 * This module implements the standard state machine of a pinball game.
 * The lifecycle is generally:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Attract mode
 * <li>Start game
 * <li>Start player
 * <li>Start ball
 * <li>End ball
 * <li>End player
 * <li>End game
 * <li>High score entry
 * <li>Match
 * </ol>
 *
 * Bonus is not really a separate state, but is part of endball.
 *
 * There is experimental support here for timed game, aka Safecracker.
 *
 * The main inputs to this module are the start button, for initiating
 * a game, and the end-of-ball condition, which is signalled based on
 * trough entry (when only one ball is in play).
