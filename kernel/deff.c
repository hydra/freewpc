/**
 * \file
 * \brief A display effect -- or deff -- is a task responsible for drawing to
 * the display (DMD or alphanumeric).
 *
 * At any given time, there may be multiple deffs which have been
 * "started", or queued to run.  However, the display can only be granted
 * to one deff at a time, so only the one with the highest "priority"
 * actually executes.
 *
 * The single running deff always has the same task group ID,
 * GID_DEFF.  Whenever priorities change, the running deff can be
 * stopped just by killing GID_DEFF and then restarting whatever
 * deff needs to be running.
 *
 * There are two kinds of deffs: normal, and running.  Running deffs
 * are special in that they are long-lived and continue to run
 * until explicitly stopped by a call to deff_stop().  Normal deffs
 * are short-lived and stop on their own once the effect completes.
 * If a normal deff can't get the display immediately, it is
 * discarded.  If a running deff can't get the display, it is queued
 * and subject to get it later if priorities change.
