/**
 * \file
 * \brief Manages the dot matrix controller (DMD)
 *
 * The DMD module manages the physical DMD resources.  The DMD
 * supports 16 pages which can be written to.  One of these pages
 * can be designated as "visible", which is what the player sees.
 * Two of these pages can be "mapped" into address space for
 * write access; unmapped pages aren't accessible.  The visible
 * and mapped pages may or may not be the same.
 *
 * 4-color images are supported through the use of page flipping.
 * Two DMD pages are reserved, one to hold the "dark" bits, another
 * to hold the "bright" bits.  The FIRQ handler switches the
 * visible image rapidly to fool the eye into seeing 4 colors.
 * The dark bits are shown 1/3 of the time; the bright bits are
 * shown 2/3 of the time.  When a mono image is desired, page
 * flipping still happens, but the dark page and the bright page
 * are the same.
 *
 * Two virtual registers, low_page and high_page, are implemented
 * in RAM over the real mapping registers.  This is because the
 * hardware registers are not readable.  Likewise, two virtual
 * registers named dark_page and bright_page, track which pages
 * have been allocated for 4-color imaging.
 *
 * The DMD controller contains the logic for refreshing the
 * display from the current visible page contents.  It clocks
 * 1 byte into the display every 32 CPU cycles, which equates to
 * one full page in roughly 8ms, or 122Hz.  In 4-color mode, two
 * pages are drawn in 3 phases (see above) for an actual refresh
 * rate of about 40Hz.  Trying to use more pages for more color
 * fails to work as the refresh rate becomes so low that the
 * page flipping becomes detectable by the human eye.
 *
 * This module also implements the generic transition algorithm.
 * All transitions share some common logic that is done here.  The
 * specifics of a particular transition are implemented in callback
 * functions defined in dmdtrans.c.
 *
 * The typical usage model for a display effect or any other code
 * that wants to write to the DMD is to (1) allocate fresh DMD pages,
 * (2) draw on them, and (3) show them.  This is so that during the
 * time the pages are being rendered, the old image continues to be
 * visible, with no drawing artifacts.
 *
 * Allocation is done very simply by iteration.  Pages are always
 * allocated in pairs in case 4-colors are desired.  No more than
 * two pairs are ever needed at once, so there is no concern for
 * overflow.  A few pages are reserved for special use and are
 * always skipped by the allocator.
