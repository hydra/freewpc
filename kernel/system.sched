# Schedule for FreeWPC's core real-time tasks
# This file is processed by the 'sched' program in tools/sched.
# Each line specifies a realtime function that needs to be called periodically.
# It also says how often it should be called (in IRQs, roughly 1ms per IRQ)
# and approximately how long the function takes to run on average (usually
# given in terms of CPU cycles).
#
# The scheduler generates a top-level function which invokes everything
# properly.  It also attempts to balance the load, so that the average
# time per IRQ is as stable as possible.


# Common processing required at the beginning of every IRQ.
