/**
 * \file
 * \brief Ball search logic
 *
 * Ball search is triggered based on idle time during a game with no
 * playfield switch closures.  While a game is in progress, a monitor
 * task runs which decrements a timer.  Various conditions are checked
 * that pause the timer; e.g. when the ball is known to be at the
 * plunger.  The switch module resets the timer every time a playfield
 * switch closes.  If the timer hits zero, it triggers an actual ball
 * search, which pulses all of the playfield solenoids that might
 * legitimiately free the ball.  This logic avoids drives attached
 * to flashers or to any game-defined devices that should be avoided,
 * like the knocker or device kickout coils.
 *
 * Ball search is currently indefinite and will gladly run forever.
 * A real machine would give up after a while, or kick another ball
 * into play.
