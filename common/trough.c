/**

 * \brief Common trough logic
 *
 * The trough device is present on all games.  The logic here handles
 * variations such as different number of switches, and different types
 * of kicker coils.
 *
 * The key action performed by the trough callbacks is to update the
 * number of "live balls".  When a ball enters/exits the trough, this
 * count is adjusted.  When live balls goes to zero, this creates the
 * end of ball condition.  When it goes up, it indicates that a ball
 * was successfully added to play.
