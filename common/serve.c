 * \file
 * \brief Logic for serving balls from the trough.
 *
 * This module implements ball serving, both for manual and auto plunges.
 * The two main APIs exposed here are serve_ball() and serve_ball_auto().
 * These add a single ball to play, either at the manual or auto plunger.
 * There is also set_ball_count() which attempts to set the global ball
 * count to an arbitrary number.
