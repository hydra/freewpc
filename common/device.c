/**
 * \file
 * \brief Ball device logic
 *
 * A ball device, or simply a device, is any playfield mechanism that
 * can hold and/or release a pinball.  Typically, a device consists of
 * one or more switches used to keep track of the number of balls in
 * the device, and a coil for ejecting a single ball from the device.
 * Examples include ejects (single ball), poppers, scoops, troughs, etc.
 * Devices are also sometimes referred to as containers.
 *
 * The machine description file declares the containers and their
 * properties.  This module contains all of the common code
 * for servicing requests from the rest of the system.  This module
 * exposes several per-device events that can be caught by the game
 * code, for example, when a ball enters a device or a kickout is
 * successful.
 *
 * The ball device code is also responsible for determining when
 * end-of-ball occurs, and keeps track of the total number of balls
 * in play at all times.
