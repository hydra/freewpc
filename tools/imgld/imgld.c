/* \file imgld.c
 * \description The FreeWPC image linker
 *
 * The image linker reads in one or more image linker command files (.ild)
 * which gives a list of images to be included in the ROM image, and
 * optionally, C-style labels that can be used to reference the images
 * from code.
 *
 * The objective is to load in all of the image files, optimize them, and
 * create an index table with pointers to the beginning of each image.
 * The C defines are simple 16-bit incremental values which are used to
 * index the table and get a pointer to the image data.  These pointers
 * are all 3-bytes long, stored as pointer/ROM page pairs.
 *
 * The basic input image format is PGM, which is a simple bitmap
 * format with 256 colors per pixel.  Frames are expected to be
 * in 128x32 size already.  When not optimizing, at a minimum, the
 * image needs to be converted into two, 128x32 joined buffers.  This
 * is the format that can be sent directly to the dot matrix board.
 * Two buffers are needed for 4-color output; the original 256 colors
 * will be downscaled to 4 colors as necessary.
 *
 * The pinball game ROM may implement a number of decoders; at present,
 * there are two supported decoders.  One does simple run-length encoding
 * of 16-bit words.  It is written for very easy decoding with little
 * runtime overhead, and so does not compress very well.  However,
 * CPU cycles are considered more precious than ROM space.  The second
 * is for sparse images with lots of zeroes.  Different codecs may be
 * added in the future with different properties; e.g. for a long-
 * running animation when the CPU is mostly idle may need to tuned
 * for better compression at the cost of a longer decompression time.
 *
 * Command-line parameters specify the total amount of space that is
 * allocated for images.  The linker should only compress as is
 * necessary: as long as there is ample space, it does not make sense
 * to compress.  If multiple codecs are available, then all should be
 * attempted and the one that matches the performance requirements the
 * best should be selected.  Images can also be tagged to denote those
 * where runtime performance is especially critical -- those would be
 * compressed *last*.  The linker continues to compress until
 * everything fits.  Then it builds the table and outputs the final image.
 *
 * The output is placed in a file dedicated for images.  A separate part
 * of the build process copies that file into the actual game ROM.
