/* Backdoor Award Rules:
 * Award the player a door for collecting 5 unlit shots
 *  
 * Targets: rightramp, slot, piano, HH, lock 
 * Unlit shot awarded when above targets collected 'unlit'
 * 
 * A jet level up awards an unlit shot.
 *
 * Unlit shots are not awarded from the same shot hit twice consectively
 *
 * Backdoor Award cannot be collected by Hitchhiker or Jets, it must be collected
 * by one of the other unlit targets
 * 
 * Collecting mpf, multiball, door panel, gumball or lock 
 * resets unlit shot count
 * 
 * Only works once per game, 20M bonus on each ball bonus thereafter */
