Coin door message "High power - disabled":
Some TZ's have the wiring for the coil interlock, some don't as it was added
later on in the run

what we do is:

- If coin door is open and we don't know if we have the wiring, 
- Inform the user that we are going to flip the top left flipper and disable buttons

  isn't present
- Make user adjustable and auto detecting
