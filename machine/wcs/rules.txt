Goals
=====
One of the main objectives of the game -- as in the past, is to score GOALS.
At game start, the Goal is lit.  Whenever Goal is lit, the spinning ball
will spin and the Goalie Target will move.  Shooting the lit Goal awards
several things:

	- 1,000,000 points are awarded.

	- The GOAL counters near the flippers are advanced to keep track
	of how many Goals you have scored in this particular run.  When
	you have scored 5 Goals, all of the lights will strobe... see
	"Multiball" below for more details.

	- An Ultra Mode (see below) is advanced.

After scoring the first Goal in a run, you need to relight it.
Unlike in the original game,
which just requires making some rollovers, you need to actually make one
of the 4 "chalk shots" (labelled "Build") to relight it: Left Loop,
Left Ramp, Striker Popper, or Right Ramp.  Whenever one of these is flashing,
it can be shot to relight the goal.

Whichever shot you use to relight Goal, that shot cannot be used again for
the same run.  So to score 5 goals, eventually you'll have to shoot all
4 chalk shots.

Shooting the unlit goal will remind you that you need to make a Build Shot
first.

After the 1st multiball, it becomes harder to complete the 5 goals
in several ways (TBD):
- Evil Goalie becomes active
- Fewer chalk shots are lit at a time
- Lit goal timeout?



Multiball
=========

After 5 Goals have been scored, Final Draw becomes lit to start Multiball.
Shoot Final Draw to start.  One additional ball is added to play, for a
minimum of 2 balls, plus any balls that have been locked will be released.

How, you ask, do you lock balls?  The left and right Free Kick saucers can
now be used as ball locks.  Under normal difficulty settings (which may be
altered in later runs), shooting the saucers at any time will lock a ball.
After 2 locks are made, Final Draw will light automatically, without requiring
5 goals.

After plunging a new ball, the balls are kicked out in this order:
Final Draw, Left saucer, Right saucer.

During multiball, the Goal scores a Jackpot, whose base value depends on (1)
how many balls you had locked, and (2) whether or not you reached the 5 Goal
mark.  In addition, the base value is multiplied by the number of balls
in play, encouraging you not to drain.  The Jackpot Value increases each
time the Goal is scored.  Relight Jackpot via the left/right ramps.

After the 1st multiball, it may be necessary to lock at least 1 ball
in a saucer before Final Draw becomes lit.


Surprise Multiball
==================

It is possible to knock a ball out of the Free Kick saucers when a ball
is held there.  When this happens, Surprise Multiball starts.  A jackpot
is enabled at the same saucer, begging you to put one of the balls back.
The value counts down to some minimum value.

If you drain one of the 2 balls during Surprise Multiball, play resumes
as normal.  If you had originally locked the ball there, you are
penalized by losing that ball lock.  If, in a multi-player game, your
opponent had locked the ball, there is no penalty for you. Your
opponent is still credited with having locked the ball for the purposes
of multiball scoring, although there may be one less ball in play.
If your opponent relocks the ball you stole, he will receive a bonus
score for doing so.


Ultra Modes
===========
The Ultra Modes work slightly differently than in the original game.
As before, Ultra Scoring is awarded after making a lit goal.  When a shot
is lit for Ultra Scoring, bonus points are awarded immediately (not
during bonus).

	- Ultra Ramps are worth 250K each.
	- Ultra Goalie is worth 250K each.
	- Ultra Spinner is worth 50K each.
	- Ultra Jets are worth 50K each.

In addition, there is a target number of shots to be made once Ultra Scoring
is started:

	- 5 Ramps or Goalies
	- 25 Spinners or Jets

Thus, the total scoring for any Ultra Mode is 1.25M once completed.

If an Ultra Mode is earned while all 4 modes are already active or complete,
then instead of starting a new mode, it will spot some # of shots on an
existing active mode -- 1 goalie hit or ramp, or 5 spinners/jets.

At end ball, all active Ultra Modes are stopped, but any modes that have
previously been completed are remembered.

The playfield "Ultra" lightning bolts will show your status for each:
off=not running, flashing=running, solid=finished.

When all 4 Ultra Modes have been completed, "Ultra Mania" is lit, and
the lamps will strobe...  see below.



Ultra Mania
===========

When Ultra Mania is qualified, the Left Ramp becomes lit for Lock and Final
Draw lights to start Ultra Mania.  
This multiball can be started immediately (2-ball), or you can shoot the Lock
to try to add additional balls into play (up to 4-ball).

If both Ultra Mania and main multiball are qualified, only Ultra Mania
will be started.  When it completes, main multiball will still be lit.

During Ultra Mania, all Ultra shots are active one more time, but you
are allowed to score 2X as many total points (same scoring per shot but
2X as many shots allowed).

Progress in Ultra Mania is carried over after the multiball ends, if
you start it again you pick up where you left off.

Each Ultra Shot can score up to 2.5M points.  Completing all 4 shots
lights Final Draw for a 10M Super Jackpot.



TV Awards
=========

TV Awards are "Mystery" awards are collected at the TV, whenever it is not
already lit for a Multiball.  The TV is lit at ball start, and relit by hitting
the Free Kick Target.

Possible awards are:

	- Quick Multiball
		- higher percentage for weaker players
		- just shoot Goals for jackpots, eventually requalify via Spinner (ala TNG)
	- Hurry Up (like the Speed Mode below)
		- never award if Speed Mode is/has run
	- Add Time (only in timed game)
	- Ball Save
	- Start Mode
		- only if Mode Start is not already lit
		- more likely if fewer modes have been played
	- Start/Advance Ultra
		- again, more likely the fewer ultras have been lit/finished.
	- Light Extra Ball (in non-timed game only)
	- Light Multiball
		- very weak game on ball 3 only
	- You're There (Collect Next City)
		- current spinner shots carry over to the next city, too
	- Points (small but random)

There will be some rules to govern how these are given out, so that it is not
entirely random.  Certain awards will never be repeated more than once per game.
Others will never repeat until all of the others in the same class have repeated.
"Points" is the default in case nothing else qualifies.


Modes
=====

There are 5 timed modes corresponding to the 5 panels on the soccer ball.
The next mode to be started can be selected via the Right Flipper button.

Shoot the 3 Striker Dog targets (2 orange, 1 red) to spell D-O-G and
light mode start at the Striker popper.

Mode rules TBD, however:

	- Modes each run on their own timer, starting at 20 seconds,
	and may overlap.
	- Mode timers reset each time the appropriate shot is made, and thus
	may run indefinitely.
	- Mode starts cannot be stacked; while mode start is lit,
	the value of the Dog targets depends on the number of modes
	actually running, and will not advance towards lighting another
	Mode Start.
   - For any mode, scoring the shot 5 times awards a Mode Bonus:
		1st - Big Points
		2nd - Light Extra Ball
		3rd - Bigger Points
		4th - Light Special
		5th (wow) - ?


Mode : Stamina
===============
Points are scored for Left or Right Ramp loop combos.
Shoot either ramp to begin the sequence, then continue shooting that
ramp for a repeated score.  The 20 second timer resets on every combo.
Double points for the right ramp over the left.


Mode : Speed
===============
This is a Hurry-Up mode, like Corvette's "Catch Me", that progresses
across multiple playfield shots.  Each made shot increases the shot
value again and resets the timer to 20 seconds.  Each successive shot,
the value of the shot will count down a little faster to its minimum.


Mode : Skill
===============
A new ball is served to the plunger, with flippers disabled.  The
objective is to make skill shots for points.  Once missed and the ball drains,
the original ball is kicked from the Striker scoop -- shoot Striker
again to repeat the process.  The 20 second timer does not run while
skill shots are attempted, and is reset by making a Skill Shot.

This mode cannot run concurrently with any multiball.



Mode : Spirit
===============
This is a frenzy mode where all switches score, but the Jet Bumpers
reset the Spirit timer to 20 seconds.


Mode : Strength
===============
Shoot the Goal repeatedly for increasing points.  Hitting the Goalie
drops the goal value.  The timer is reset each time the Goal is made.


Super Dog
=========

Once all 5 modes have been started, the next completion of
the dog targets will light Super Dog at the Striker scoop.
Super Dog cannot be started during any other multiball.  A jackpot value
is established based on the total number of seconds that modes were running
prior to starting Super Dog.  (You can leave it lit while the 5th mode
is running to boost the value!)

If multiple modes are running concurrently, this is taken into account, and
multiplies the total time increment.  If a ball drains ending one or
more modes, the amount of time left is not counted.
This counter also pauses during ball search and other times when normal
timers would pause.

Shoot the Dog targets as often as you like to score the Jackpot Value.
Super Dog runs on a 30 second timer, with a short ballsaver.
The timer is reset to 30 seconds once *all three* targets are hit.

This should be a 2-ball multiball.


Cities
======
Cities are advanced by repeated shots to the spinner.
A certain number of spins is required in order to collect the next city.
When a city is collected, the top gate opens allowing the ball to whiz out
the right side of the playfield.

The current City affects general scoring in some way.
Note that only *one* can be in effect at a time, so you may choose
to avoid shooting for the next city if the current feature is lucrative --
advancing the city will cancel the previous benefit.

Per-ball, each city reached scores 500K + 100K.

The first city, Chicago, requires 12 spins to reach.  Each city thereafter
takes an additional 4 spins.  The Left Orbit switch will always spot 4
spins.

	- Chicago - 2X Combos
	- Dallas
	- Boston - 2X Mode
	- New York
	- Orlando - 2X Ultra
	- Washington D.C. - Extra Ball Lit
	- San Francisco - 2X Jackpots
	- Detroit
	- Los Angeles - 2X Scoring

The final award, 2X Scoring, can run until end-of-ball, but it will
time out in 30 seconds.  Shooting the Left Loop/Spinner adds 10 seconds
to the clock, up to a max of 30 seconds.  When 2X Scoring times out, the
cities reset to the beginning again.

(Note: a single Spinner flip does not count... it should take two spins
to equal a loop shot, to make it harder).

All of the 2X modes run during multiballs as well.


World Cup Final
===============

To qualify World Cup Final, you must start all of the following:
- Goal Multiball
- Ultra Mania
- Super Dog
- 2X Scoring

Once these 4 tasks have been achieved, and no multiball is in
progress, the Left and Right Ramp locks will become lit.
Shoot either to start World Cup Final.

During Final, unlimited balls are served from the trough for 45 seconds
as before.  The Goal collects an increasing Jackpot value (1M, 1.1M, 1.2M,
etc. up to 2M per goal).
The Build Shots increase the jackpot even further (+250K for the shot,
plus +100K to the goal value.)



Feature Adjustments
===================

Ball Saver
Evil Goalie : Defaults to NO.  When set to YES, Goalie movement
will be altered to make the game more difficult.

Max Lock Count
Reverse Spin
Disable Ball
Disable Goalie
