# This is the image load config file, which lists the graphics
# images that are imported into the final ROM image.
#
# Each entry in this file is of the form:
#
# <id>: <filename>
#
# and causes one image file to be imported, which can be
# referenced from the code using the C #define named by <id>.
# Identifiers are integers that index a table of all images.
# An image ID can be passed to the frame_draw() function for
# fullscreen (128x32) images or to bmp_draw() for arbitrary-sized
# images.
#
# This file contains only the machine-specific images.
# The platform can define its own common images, in
# platform/<name>/<name>.ild.
#
# If a filename is prefixed with '!', the image data is
# inverted.
#
# Identifiers are optional; if not given, an ID is assigned
# internally but no C #define is written out for it.  As
# IDs are sequential, an animation can have IDs for the first
# and last frame only, and just use a for loop to render each
# frame.
