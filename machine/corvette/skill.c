/**
 * @TODO Currently on a real machine the skill shot is turned off after the player launches a ball
 *       Ignore more switch presses?
 *
 * @TODO The flashing lamp for the active rollover isn't changed quickly enough.
 *       There can be up to about 1 second before the state is reflected by the lamp.
 *       Use something like: lamplist_rotate_previous (LAMPLIST_INLANES, lamp_matrix) instead?
