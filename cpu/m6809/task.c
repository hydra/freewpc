/**
 * \file
 * \brief This module implements a round-robin, non-realtime, non-preemptive
 * task scheduler.
 *
 * A "task" is analogous to a process.  Tasks can be created, stopped,
 * killed, etc. as one would expect.  All tasks are "peers", as no
 * parent/child relationship exists among the tasks.
 * 
 * The process ID of a task is simply a pointer to its kernel task
 * structure; every task therefore has a unique pid.
 *
 * The group ID of a task can be declared when it is created; multiple
 * tasks can share the same group ID.  Killing a group ID kills all
 * tasks in the group.  Group IDs exist in order to make it easier to
 * find tasks based on a small fixed data value, rather than requiring
 * process IDs to be stored in costly RAM.
 *
 * Most of the module is written in portable C.  The task structure
 * and the register save/restore routines are written in lots of
 * assembler, though.
 *
 * Caveats:
 * 1) Inside functions that use a lot of assembly, we expect register
 * X to be preserved across calls (e.g. task_save -> task_dispatcher).
 * Please do NOT make any ordinary function calls in these types of
 * routines, as they are likely to trash registers in unexpected ways.

 * probably unused.  The table will only fill up when there are MANY
 * tasks running at once, which is not normally the case.  If the
 * table becomes full, the tail will extend out allowing more entries
