The files in directory are only used when building FreeWPC to run
in standalone simulation.  Reads and writes from the memory-mapped
hardware registers are replaced by functions builtin to the program.
These are then simulated.

The effect is best described as taking a game ROM and PinMAME,
and compiling them together into a single program.

This program becomes an executable that runs on your build machine.
This means you can debug it like any other software.  It contains
no target processor specific code, like 6809 assembly language.

The core simulator files contain logic to emulate common pinball
devices.  You will need to write machine-specific or platform-
specific code to define what your machine actually has.
