/*	Each hardware signal that is simulated has a unique "signal number",
	which is given in this enum.  Groups of related signals have
	consecutive values, then only the first signal in the group is named
	here.

	We define a signal for any value that we might want to monitor,
	even if it is not directly driven by the CPU.  For example, the
	wall voltages, the generated voltages, blanking, etc.

	The maximum number of hardware signals defined this way is MAX_SIGNALS.

	We also support 'automatic signals', which are computed on the fly rather
	than stored in memory.  Those have a signal number above MAX_SIGNALS.
	See signo.c for more information.
