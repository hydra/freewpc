be started right away, it is immediately dropped.  Otherwise, it is placed 
onto the deff queue.  Likewise, the deff may be preempted by a higher-
priority deff later, and this bit will ensure that the deff is requeued
and can be restarted later.  A deff marked D_QUEUED may need to be
explicitly stopped via deff_stop() when conditions change, or the deff

deff remains on the queue for longer than some predetermined amount
of time, it is automatically stopped.  Note that the timeout varies

we can hold the ball and service more deffs than if the ball is
