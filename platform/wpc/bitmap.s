; This file implements a fast bitmap blit function, which can draw
; an uncompressed bitmap onto an arbitrary location on the DMD.
; It has several advantages over the old C version:
;
; - Bits are shifted at most once.  Before, for each byte, we did two shifts.
; The second shift was even worse because we negated the shift count too.
; Now, every input byte is shifted exactly one time.  If it is not needed
; right away, the bits are saved in an 'overflow' register that is used on
; the next iteration.
;
; - Optimal code is added for some common cases, where the byte width of the
; image is 1 or 2 bytes, and at most 16-bits are actually written per row.
; Here, we can use 16-bit read/write operations for efficiency.  These
; cases arise with smaller fonts, which makes rendering large strings much
; better.
;
; - Shift logic is refactored.  The shift count does not change throughout
; the procedure, so the shift function is a constant for a single run.
;
; - Less code overall.  It's more compact, so it runs faster.
;
; - For large bitmaps, interior bytes can be MOVed directly to memory;
; there is no need to OR into whatever is there.  ORing is only required
; on the edges when we are not byte-aligned.

	; Examine the width and shift to determine the best way to
	; render this bitmap.  There are 3 methods implemented here:
	; one is generic and works in all cases, but it has high
	; overhead for small bitmaps, which are common with fonts.
	; The other 2 methods are optimized for small bitmaps.
	; These methods are called do_large, loop8, and loop16.

	cmpa	#8					; Is the source data 8-bits?
	bgt	loop16			; No, use the loop16 method
								; Yes, use the loop8 method

	; loop8 works when the source data is 8 bits wide or less per row,
	; for all shift values (the input is extended to and written
	; 16-bits at a time).  It is slightly inefficient if source
	; plus shift is also within 8-bits, but this is a rare
	; case (small font, really small shift value).
	; Unrolling this for bitmap_height makes no sense since the
	; height is also likely to be a small value.

	; loop16 works when the source data is 16-bits wide, and

	; That is, shifting does not increase the number of
	; output bytes to be written.  This is the most optimal
	; case, similar to above but we can read input data twice
